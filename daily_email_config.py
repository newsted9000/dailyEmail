# Medition Quotes
med_quotes = [
	"To hear un-welcomed truths",
	"....I need to train and discipline my character",
	"....that a man can show both strength and flexibility",
	"To be free of passion and yet full or love",
	"Doing your job without whining",
	"The sense he gave of staying on the path rather than being kept on it.",
	"The way he handled the material comforts that fortune had supplied to him- without arrogance and without apology. If it were there, he took advantage of them. If not, he did not miss them.",
	"(Like Socrates) that he knew how to enjoy and abstain from things that most people find it hard to abstain from and all to easy to enjoy.",
	"That I had the kind of brother that I did. Ones whose character challenged me to improve y own. Ones whose love and affection enriched my life."
	'Whatever this is I am, it is flesh, and a little spirit and an intelligence. [.....] Think of your intelligence this way: Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfing impulses, to kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future.',
	'Yes, keep on degrading yourself- soul. But soon your chance at dignity will be gone. Everyone gets one life. Yours is almost up, and instead of treating yourself with respect, you have entrusted your own happiness to the souls of others.',
	'....stop letting yourself be pulled in all directions. But make sure you safe guard against the other kind of confusion. People who labor al their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought and impulse toward are waisting their time- even when hard at work.',
	'Never forget what proportion of the world I make-up.',
	'Sins committed out of desire are worse than the ones committed out of anger.',
	'You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.',
	'...things that entice us with pleasure or frighten us with pain or are loudly trumpeted by pride. To understand those things- how stupid, contemptible, grimy, decaying, and dead they are- that is what our intellectual powers are for.',
	'The present is all that you can give up, since that is all you have, and what you do not have, you cannot lose.',
	'Then what can guide us? Only philosophy. Which means making sure that the power within stays safe and free from assault, superior to pleasure and pain, doing nothing randomly or dishonestly and with imposture, not dependent on anyone elses doing something or not doing it.',
	'The struggle not to be overwhelmed by anything that happens.',
	'People try to get away from it all- to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within. Nowhere you can go is more peaceful- more free of interruptions- than your own soul.',
	'If you seek tranquillity, do less." Or (more accurately) do what is essential- what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings double satisfaction: to do less, better.',
	'Nothing that goes on in anyone elses mind can harm you.',
	'The things you think about determine the quality of you mind. Your soul takes on the color of your thoughts.'
	'Nothing happens to anyone that he can\'t endure. The same thing happens to other people, and they weather it unharmed- out of sheer obliviousness or because they want to display \'character.', 
	'Is wisdom really so much weaker than ignorance and vanity?'
	'If it does not harm the community, it does not harm its members. When you think you\'ve been injured, apply this rule: If the community isn\'t injured by it, neither am I. And if it is, anger is not the answer. Show the offender where he went wrong.',
	'Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone.....So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or any indignation, either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.', 
	'Honor and revere the gods, treat human beings as they deserve to be treated, be tolerant with others and strict with yourself. Remember, nothing belongs to you but your flesh and blood- and nothing else is under your control.', 
	'Just do the right thing. The rest doesn\'t matter. Cold or warm. Tired or well-rested. Despised or honored. Dying or busy with other assignments.',
	'Pride is a master of deception: when you think you\'re occupied in the weightiest business, that\'s when he has you in his spell.',
	'We find ourselves in a river. Which of the things around us should we value when none of them can offer a firm foothold?',
	'What\'s left for us to prize? I think it is this: to do (and not do) what we were designed for....So that\'s what we should prize. Hold on to that, and you won\'t be tempted to aim at anything else. And if you can\t stop prizing a lot of other things? Then you\'ll never be free- free, independent, imperturbable.',
	'The way people behave. They refuse to admire their contemporaries, the people whose lives they share. No, but to be admired by Posterity- people they\'ve never met and never will- that\'s what they set their hearts on. You might as well be upset at not being a hero to your great-grandfather.',
	'Not to assume it\'s impossible because you find it hard. But to recognize that if it\'s humanly possible, you can do it too.'
